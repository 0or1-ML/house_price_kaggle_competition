# Overview

It is group work in order to improve our soft and hard skills. We are participating in notoriously known competition in Kaggle.
[Link to the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/rules).
Do not worry, there are no deadlines and other prerequisites, unfortunately there is no money reward too.

# Purpose

Imagine : you are working remotely, while living in Hawaii, and your company "ООО Рога и Копыта" wants to predict house price based on some collected data.
Such educational practise gives you experience in working remotely (because till the february we can not work offline) and 
in team working on real project. We will try to support worknig conditions as real as posible.

# Why Kaggle ?

Because it is the most popular data science community in the world.

# How will it be organized ?

Honestly, we do not have any experience in it. That's why we should try. 
Did you hear about : SCRUM, CRISP-DM, Slack, TDD and Code Review ? Me neither, but our colleagues data scientists use it everyday, 
so we better get in asap.
Of course, we can read books about them, but nothing can replace practise.

## First and foremost

Please log in Kaggle, it is free and they give 30h. of GPU time a week to train AI !
We will submit our solutions as a team.
You can also participate in many more competitions with big money rewards individually.

## Development Methodology

In software industry there are many development methodologies and we will use symbiosis of 2 most popular : Kanban and SCRUM.
It roughly works in such a way :
We will keep track of what we have done, have to do and in progress : ![Kanban](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg)

It was Kanban, SCRUM is when we break huge task into small tasks and iteratively solve them like : 
this week we do one thing, next week second, third and etc.
And in the end of the week (beginning of the next iteration) everybody report what he/she has done, what were the faced issues, 
what tasks who will do during next iteration and etc.

### Why do we need all of the above ?

We will see our progress. It is very important. When you see your progress it motivates a lot and 
do not let programmers to procrastinate, as you will feel resposibility to team.
Eventually, DS society use it and it looks like it works better than nothing.
Also, it will improve our skills of estimation of the work.

## Code Review

It is when you submit your code and your colleagues check it and when everything is done correctly - deploy it.
We will work here, in GitHub repo. Do not know what git, pull-request and merge means ? No problem ! Google it and feel free 
to try everything, as you can not drop prod here.

# Contribution

Feel free to contribute, ask questions and propose ideas, there are no strict rules there.
